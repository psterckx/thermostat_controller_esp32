# Thermostat Controller - ESP32

ESP32 code as part of my [Thermostat Controller Project](https://gist.github.com/psterckx/7c476532f7399b15b974ee3dff919d3f). The Arduino code in this repo enables the ESP32 to interact with AWS IoT Core by subscribing to and publising MQTT messages. The ESP32 actuates solenoids that change the set temperature on the thermostat and reads a measured temperature value using a DHT sensor.
